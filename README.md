# Estroengine v0.1.5
[![estroengine](https://robinsaviary.com/gifs/estroengine.gif)](https://blinkies.cafe/?s=0023-trans-pride)

A portable simple-to-use node-tree-based game engine built in C++.
The entire engine is header-only so it can be easily integrated.
[Premake](https://premake.github.io/) is a work-in-progress.

Estroengine currently supports two libraries as backends:
* [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)
* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)


I occasionally post about Estroengine on my website:
