# Estroengine 0.5.0

[![estroengine](https://robinsaviary.com/gifs/estroengine.gif)](https://blinkies.cafe/?s=0023-trans-pride)

An *open source, portable, easy-to-use node-tree-based game engine* built in *C++20*.

Heavily inspired by engines such as [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), [Source](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SDK_Docs), and [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en).

## Building

The current version of the repisitory includes a `CMakeLists.txt` (for [CMake](https://cmake.org/)) for building Estroengine (as a static library) as part of your project :)

This project also features generable documentation from [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).

## Backends

Estroengine currently supports two libraries as backends:
* [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) (Web, Windows, MacOS, Linux)
* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) (Windows, MacOS, Linux)

## Notes on sub-libraries
*Estrovector* - C#-style math vectors.

*Estrocolors* - Generic Color struct & base engine colors.

## License

Estroengine is provided under the [Unlicense License](https://unlicense.org/).
Free for any type of use (personal, commercial, etc.) and credit of this library is not required - but always appreciated!
